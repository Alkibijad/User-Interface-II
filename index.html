                <p> Throughout my career, I have developed a reputation as a visionary professional with an exceptional education, meaningful cultural experience, and a passion for elevating human potential. I am a forward-thinking professional with the ability to uncover root causes and encourage teams to discover previously unrealized solutions with a focus on values and culture.
                I am known to be a collaborative team player with high emotional intelligence and the ability to plan, prioritize, manage, and complete undertakings within fast-paced, deadline-driven situations. And I am a highly analytical thinker with expertise in Customer Service, Project / Event Management, Office Management, Personnel Supervision, Process Improvement, Stocks & Finance, Nonprofit Fundraising, and SEC Legal Procedures.
                Perhaps the most important, I am an excellent communicator with the capacity to use creativity to determine the best course of action for the business as a whole through the use of skills that transfer across multiple industries and positions.
